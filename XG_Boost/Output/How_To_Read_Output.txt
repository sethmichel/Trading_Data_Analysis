shap
- x axis shows if it contributed to failed trades or successful trades. it's how much that feature contributed to pushing the model’s 
prediction higher or lower
    + means that feature pushed the prediction toward the positive class (e.g., "trade success")
    - means that feature pushed the prediction toward the negative class (e.g., "trade failure")

-y axis is mainly a list of features sorted by importance. not that useful
    the color scale on the side isn't an axis, it's a color code for the dots

color of the dots: it's how high/low that feature value is in its possibel range (the actual raw value not the impact on the model)
    rsi of 95 is red, but 23 is blue

why are red dots on the left side then?
    for rsi for example it means 


critical for my data to remember
- rsi: normal rsi is bad because both blue and red kind of mean the same thing. I convert them to the absoluate distance from 50. meaning 50 is blue, and 
    30 and 70 are both red
- macd val/avg: it's the absolute values
- seconds since open is flipped, so higher values = later in the day
