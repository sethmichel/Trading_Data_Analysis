'ticker' tells the stock id (there are 7 different ones), entry time, exit time, time in trade are timstamps, most other columns are floats, trade type is 'short' or 'buy', and the column '0.3' basically tells if the trade was a success or not; it says if it reached the target price, and it's 1 or 0
