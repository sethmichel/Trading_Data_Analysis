Purpose: 
1) auto gather best/worst exit info to min max trades. 
2) test any sl/target to see how it would have done.

Components
headers = ["Date", "Ticker", "Entry Time", "Exit Time", 'Time in trade', "Entry Price", "Exit Price", "Shares", "$ Change", "% Change", 
           'Total Investment', "Buy/Short", "Technical Type", "Best Exit Price", "Best Exit Percent", 'Worst Exit Price', 
           'Worst Exit Percent']
1) DONE convert tos raw csv's into useable format. so each trade
2) add in best/worst exits.
    - required: same day of tos raw logs and market data. 
    - how: once step 1 is done, make 4 new colums in the existing converted csv: price and percent of best and worst exits. Use the 
    entry and exit times and buy/short to look for the best and worst prices during that time based on the entry. Keep in mind worst exits
    can be my sl.
3) add in atr entry data
    - how: using my step 2 algorithm, add in the atr14 and atr28 data from the market data

End result: all those headers

How to use max effectivly: needs a corresponding sheet where I'll add all my trades from all csv's. set a target/sl for the sheet, 
import the csv, it should tell you all data you need. The sheet will have 1 general tab with all stocks. and 1 tab for each stock 
invdidually. each tab will have the following inputs
-sheet inputs: 
            - target, stop loss -> shows change using best/worst exits
            - and it should have a timetable showing trade gains at each time of day
            - figure out how to find the best target/sl per atr value
